# Open source adoption factors. A systematic review

Nowadays, Free/Libre/OpenSource Software (FLOSS) is becoming a strategic option for many organizations in the public and the private sector. The lack of well defined guidelines for IT managers may jeopardize the FLOSS adoption process. FLOSS adoption procedures are developed ad-hoc in every organization, hence, leading to potential wheel reinvention situations. Identifying factors that influence and determine adoption is crucial. In this article, we survey existing literature through systematic review methodologies to make visible the technical, organizational and economic factors that must be evaluated in the adoption process. We also provide hints for researchers on publications and the type of research that already covered this topic in the past. We studied more than 2,000 papers  from which we selected a final set of 37 primary studies directly related to FLOSS adoption. We found twenty two different adoption factors categorized as technical (nine), organizational (nine) and economic (four). The most referenced factor support which gives hints that is one of the major concerns when adopting FLOSS solutions is the availability of internal and external support. This article aims to provide the basic building blocks to step into the creation of a guide for the FLOSS adoption.
